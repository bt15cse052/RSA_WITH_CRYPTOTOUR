## RSA With Crypto Tour

+ This approach is an implementation of the widely used RSA public key cryptosystem. 
+ It uses Knight’s tour scrambler or Crypto tour for scrambling our public keys and cipher text before and after encrypting our message. -- The classical RSA encryption system is vulnerable to a factorization attack hence this proposed approach focuses on that vulnerability and tries to tackle it by using the knight’s tour scrambler. 
- It is a block cipher approach and encrypts a block of 64 bit of data at a time. it also uses a set of key values to encrypt the message rather than using same key values for different bits of the message.
